## Description

Are you highly skilled in the art of forgetfulness? I know I am! We're here to offer you some Peace of Mind.

Peace of Mind is a task management app that won't let you forget. Get an indefinite number of alerts via SMS, email, and
voice, so you can't ignore the task at hand.

## Motivation

Time management has gotten tricky since the start of the pandemic. People are experiencing difficulty perceiving the
passage of time, and often feeling "brain fog".

Some tasks are too important to be delayed or forgotten, like taking medications, caring for others, or caring for
yourself.
